This is project NO.1
I will make a website about recipes. 
There will be more pages.
I will be using links, headings, tabels, images and so on.
I will use GIT through terminal to upload documents/pages to GitHub. 
I think that I will have some problems with GIT and how to connect everything as this is my first project using it.
